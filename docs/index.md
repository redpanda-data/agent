**This project** provides a flexible system where an *Agent* can answer questions and use specialized *Tools* to tackle tasks. 
The Agent can also connect to external services through different **MCPEndpoints**, letting it integrate with remote or local resources. 

A **RuntimeServer** exposes the Agent over gRPC, so outside applications can interact with it. 
The project includes *hooks* to track key events (like before or after a tool is called) and a *ToolResponse* structure for sending back text or images neatly. 

The **RPKMCPEndpoint** even simplifies testing by running a local command to simulate a server inside your development folder.
